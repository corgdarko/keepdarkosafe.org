      <p class="intro">
        Hello. If you’re reading this, you’re already part of the club — people who instantly fall for <b>Darko</b>.
        He’s not “just a dog”… he’s a corgi with <i>attitude</i>, charisma, drama, and a huge heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darko has that rare “small but powerful” energy. He walks like the floor belongs to him,
        and when he enters a room, the vibe changes instantly: either he looks at you like a judge,
        or greets you like you’ve been best friends forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        His personality is the perfect mix:
        <b>curious</b> (he needs to inspect EVERYTHING),
        <b>protective</b> (even if he’s only about a foot tall),
        <b>professional clown</b> (unexpected zoomies),
        and <b>master negotiator</b> (he can get snacks with just one look).
      </p>

      <p>
        The funniest part is his “corgi mode”: out of nowhere he activates turbo,
        spins around like a top, and then collapses as if he just worked a 12-hour shift.
        And yes… if you hear a dramatic sigh, it’s probably Darko not getting attention
        in the last 30 seconds.
      </p>
